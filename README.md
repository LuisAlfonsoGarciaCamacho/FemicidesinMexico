# FemicidesinMexico
A deep study of femicides in Mexico since 1990 to 2022
This research delves into the pressing issue of feminicides in Mexico, spanning the period from 1990 to 2022. Utilizing data sourced from the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) and the official government website, our study aims to meticulously examine trends in the numbers of female homicides and feminicides across the decades. The primary objective is to identify potential causes contributing to a potential underreporting of feminicides in official records.

Methodology:

My methodology involves a comprehensive analysis of the INEGI data and government records, utilizing statistical tools and techniques to discern patterns and trends in the occurrence of feminicides over the specified timeframe. The research team will employ both quantitative and qualitative methods to gain a nuanced understanding of the complexities surrounding this issue.

Objectives:

1. **Trend Analysis**: Identify and analyze temporal patterns in the prevalence of feminicides over the years, highlighting any significant spikes, declines, or recurring trends.

2. **Comparative Analysis**: Examine regional variations and disparities in feminicide rates, aiming to identify hotspots and regions with particularly concerning trends.

3. **Underreporting Factors**: Investigate potential causes for underreporting of feminicides, including legal loopholes, misclassification of cases, and social or cultural factors that may contribute to the discrepancy between official records and the actual occurrence of these crimes.

4. **Policy Implications**: Provide recommendations for policy improvements based on the identified trends and underreporting causes, aiming to enhance the accuracy of feminicide data collection and reporting mechanisms.

Methodology (Continued):

5. **Time Series Analysis and Forecasting:** To gain insights into future trends and variations, we employed the Prophet package in Python for time series analysis. This powerful tool allowed us to model and forecast the occurrences of feminicides and female homicides based on historical data, providing a predictive element to our study.

   - **Data Preprocessing:** The data from INEGI and government records were preprocessed to ensure compatibility with the Prophet model. Missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies were addressed to maintain the accuracy of the forecasting.

   - **Prophet Model Implementation:** The Prophet package was utilized to create time series models for feminicides and female homicides, taking into account seasonal patterns, holidays, and other relevant factors. This model was then applied to the historical data spanning 1990 to 2014 to generate a preliminary forecast.

   - **Prediction Validation:** The accuracy of the Prophet model was validated using appropriate metrics, ensuring that the forecasted values align closely with the actual historical data. This step was crucial to establish the reliability of the forecasting results.

Results and Preliminary Findings:

The initial application of the Prophet model on the feminicide data from 1990 to 2014 yielded insightful predictions, shedding light on potential future trends. While the comprehensive analysis of these predictions is ongoing, the preliminary findings indicate that the forecasting capabilities of the Prophet model hold promise in anticipating patterns in feminicide rates.

This integration of time series analysis and forecasting not only contributes to a more holistic understanding of historical trends but also equips policymakers with tools to anticipate potential future challenges. The ongoing research aims to refine and expand upon these initial predictions, providing a robust foundation for informed decision-making and targeted interventions to address the critical issue of feminicides in Mexico.
Significance:

The significance of this research lies in its potential to contribute to the development of more effective policies and interventions aimed at combating feminicides in Mexico. By understanding the nuances of underreporting, authorities can refine their strategies to ensure accurate representation and address the root causes of this alarming issue. This research aims to shed light on the challenges and complexities associated with tracking feminicides, ultimately fostering a safer environment for women in Mexico.
